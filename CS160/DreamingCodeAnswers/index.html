<h1>Miscellaneous Answers!</h1>

<h1>Big Ball of Mud</h1>

<p>When people imagine how programs are created, they tend to see snapshots of the matrix 
    in their head of 1s and 0s flashing across a screen as a guy covered in sweat bangs away at his 
    keyboard. In reality, programmers tend to throw together what others in the field call 'big balls of mud'. 
    Mud is simply a mess of code that just, works, for the user. Some believe the back end of a program should have a distinct architecture to it, 
    being built like some roman colosseum. I can understand the desire for this, to assist those that
    need to delve into the code if a problem arises, but with your typical 'mud ball' the coder has the ability to
    reach right in and mess with any issues on the front end for the user without having to worry about hurting the layout.

<h1>DevOps</h1>

<p>While some might believe that when it comes to creating a new program or working with a business to build
    a platform etc. that the customer and development team work together to create the right idea said customer had.
    The reality is that customers tend to give a development team an idea with some restrictions on what they would like to see
    this program/platform/etc. perform. This gives a ton of free space for creativity for the development team, and while some believe
    that this is a good thing, creating concepts that are unique to a business, the team tasked with creating this may turn to an idea
    and follow it the rest of the build. The idea can lead to a product so far off the mark that the project must be restarted, wasting everyone's time!
    DevOps is the concept of keeping the development management, the production team, and customer all on the same page working together
    to create something worth while. DevOps focuses on quick and flexible feedback between creater and customer while maintaining an up-to-date application 
    that is easily manageable if the customer doesn't agree with a certain aspect. The ability for the continuous connection between customer and creator allows for
    user analytics that can improve the overall quality constantly to create the exact product the consumer is looking for.

<h1>Inevitable Pain</h1>

<p>Software development is to this day a mystery that we have barely scratched the surface of. While some see it as pure magic, the ins and outs of software
    as it seems is just banging your head against a keyboard until your program mysteriously works. For someone on the outside looking in, software can be a difficult thing to wrap your
    head around, and even those that create it can share that same idea! We have mastered the art of hardware, with how straightforward it seems to be; Big Legos you stick
    together to create working parts. However, software can be a fickle subject to work with; Anytime you begin to add a new piece to your whole picture, it could fall apart at any moment.
    This is the constant struggle behind software development, venturing into the unknown anytime there is need for innovation.
