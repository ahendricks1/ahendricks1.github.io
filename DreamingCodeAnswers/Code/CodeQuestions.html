    <li>The four types of logic gates include: AND, OR, NAND, and NOR. The AND gate requires 
        two inputs in the closed position to power the output. An OR gate requires at least one of two inputs to be 
        closed for the output to power the output. NOR is a spin off of our OR gate that uses an inverter 
        to invert voltage, and only feeds power to the output when the input switches are open. NAND follows the same 
        idea but can feed power to the output as long as both switches aren't closed</li>

    <li>A half adder consists of 8 relays jointed from an XOR gate and an AND gate, as well as 2 inputs, and 2 outputs.</li>
    <li>A full adder is made up of two half adders and an OR gate, with 18 relays total. The full adder however has 3 inputs, and 2 outputs.</li>
    <li>An 8-bit circuit contains a massive 17 inputs if you count the carry in, and 9 outputs if you include the carry out.</li>
    <li>144 transistors!</li>
