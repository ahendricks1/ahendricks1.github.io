<p>Hey look it's Dreaming in Code answers!</p>

Chapter 0
<ol>
    <li>Donald Knuth, author of programming field’s most respected textbooks.</li>
    <li>Zero</li>
    <li>“Obsesive programming tinkerer”</li>
    <li>66%</li>
    <li>Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.</li>
</ol>
Chapter 1
<ol>
    <li>Programmers, and the founder of OSAF</li>
    <li>A program created to keep track of all programming tasks that must be finished </li>
    <li>Open Source Application Foundation</li>
    <li>Chandler</li>
    <li>“Personal information manager”</li>
    <li>Scary</li>
    <li>You couldn’t even begin to say for sure how long they would take to fix.</li>
    <li>” An important problem that we don’t have the consensus on how to attack.”</li>
    <li>Lateness on a project</li>
    <li>The operating system for the IBM System/360</li>
    <li>“Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.</li>
    <li>16.66%</li>
    <li>50%</li>
    <li>No communication between the people working together</li>
    <li>Source code is protected by a binary file whereas you can peer into a .exe file to play with it.</li>
    <li>“Software that anyone can tinker with is bound to improve over time in ways that ‘closed’ software can’t match.”</li>
    <li>Good programmers know what to write, great programmers know what to rewrite (and reuse).</li>
    <li>The Cathedral, much like Microsoft, follows a distinct process of building up into a beautiful structure. While the Bazaar seems like a strange way to run something, with the large number of people working within the same area, it still pulls it off.</li>
    <li>It wasn’t necessarily refuted, since people were joining together to work on open source projects for entertainment purposes, and it also came with its own problems.</li>
    <li>To “Get excited work going; The rest of it will take care of itself” using each other’s excitement to create a productive work environment. </li>
</ol>
Chapter 2
<ol>
    <li>Kapor left after 4 years after Lotus' saga began. He left for reasons pertaining to himself not initially looking to create a capitalistic business.</li>
    <li>'To respond to technical disagreements by splitting into rival camps.'</li>
    <li>When referring to 'Witchcraft' Torvalds is discussing the idea of keeping software guarded. Whereas with science, it's all about learning and building off of others results.</li>
    <li>In 1968 at the San Francisco Convention Center, Douglas Engelbart showed off his NLS.</li>
    <li>'Bootstrapping' or pulling one's self up by the bootstraps to describe the computer starting up.</li>
    <li>Xerox's Palo Alto Reasearch Center.</li>
    <li>The FBI's Virtual Case File; McDonald's Innovate project; Ford's Everest system.</li>
    <li>The Standish Group's Chaos Report submitted statistics showing the utter overhead failure of projects and how this is causing a crisis. In reality this 'crisis' is simply a narrow-minded definition of what success is.</li>
    <li>We have surpassed the means of initial use for software. We absolutely depend on it in our daily lives, and this leads to software writers moral responsibility to be truthful with their work.</li>
</ol>
Chapter 3
<ol>
    <li>When initially building a project, there's bound to be issues riddle within it upon release, thus planning for failure.</li>
    <li>Researching user behavior patterns.</li>
    <li>Responsible for choosing the building blocks that the programmers would use to create their software.</li>
    <li>The 'core-dump' is a crash report meant for bug-hunters to inspect. The term 'core' is used due to the fact that these chips are at the physical core of one's computer.</li>
    <li>"Pile layers of abstractions on top of other layers we got from somebody else." He described how to create a simple, base function. This function requires small tasks working together to form a fluid action.</li>
    <li>Assembly language.</li>
    <li>A compiler.</li>
    <li>Our ability to process information can only expand so much before we are at capacity and/or can retain more. Chips are capable of processing as much as their capacity.</li>
    <li>Interpreted language waits to perform the binary code translation until said program runs, unlike compiled languages that run the source code through a compiler ahead of tiime.</li>
    <li>October 20, 2002.</li>
</ol>
Chapter 4
<ol>
    <li>The front end is the piece of the program that interacts with the user and his/her inputs. The back end is where the users inputs are converted so the computer can make sense of them and react accordingly.</li>
    <li>The lego hypothesis refers to the idea of programs will be made out of shared parts. Furthermore, the software will be available anywhere and be pieced together, much like legos. Simply snap together the pieces you need to create a specific program.</li>
    <li>There seems to be an infinite number of factors as to why these snap-and-go pieces of software would never work, such as the software being built on a specific format and then forced into an entirely different format; Like starting a project with glue, then deciding to finish with tape.</li>
</ol>
Chapter 5
<ol>
    <li>When working on a project, the programmer must deal with the 'impossible triangle', that is to acknowledge the triangle of fast, cheap, and good. After you acknowledge this triangle, you may only pick two. Thus spawned the name the 'impossible triangle'.</li>
    <li>"A person who has chosen concentration rather than conformity; one who pursues skill (especially technical skill) and imagination, not mainstream social acceptance."</li>
    <li>Rewriting a chunk of code to make it briefer, clearer, and easier to read without changing what it actually does.</li>
    <li>"A seemingly pointless activity which is actually necessary to solve a problem which solves a problem which, several levels of recursion later, solves the real problem you're working on.</li>
</ol>
Chapter 6
<ol>
    <li>Edge cases are unlikely scenarios or extreme possibilities that can affect a programs usage when a user chooses to do sporadic actions.</li>
    <li>Larger projects are much more difficult tasks to approach, since you must take into account all variables when creating it, thus forcing an overdesign. Torvalds mentions to start small and work your way to a larger scale.</li>
</ol>
Chapter 7
<ol>
    <li>Hungarian notation is a famous scheme for naming variables, through the use of prefixes attached to a variable to give it meaning to anyone reading the code.</li>
    <li>The ability for a programmer to talk to a non-programmer through the machine, using a feasible syntax that a non-programmer can comprehend.</li>
</ol>
Chapter 8
<ol>
    <li>'Dogfooding' is taking the code you've built and implement it into your own routine, taking it for a test run. As if to self-diagnose the program.</li>
    <li>"...make them up." This idea stems from the basics of creating a finished product; There's simply no way to tell for certain when a program will be 100% finished taking all the variables into account.</li>
