<h1>Big Ball of Mud</h1>

<p>When people imagine how programs are created, they tend to see snapshots of the matrix 
    in their head of 1s and 0s flashing across a screen as a guy covered in sweat bangs away at his 
    keyboard. In reality, programmers tend to throw together what others in the field call 'big balls of mud'. 
    Mud is simply a mess of code that just, works, for the user. Some believe the back end of a program should have a distinct architecture to it, 
    being built like some roman colosseum. I can understand the desire for this, to assist those that
    need to delve into the code if a problem arises, but with your typical 'mud ball' the coder has the ability to
    reach right in and mess with any issues on the front end for the user without having to worry about hurting the layout.
